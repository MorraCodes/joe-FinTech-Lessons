    "So far, you’ve accessed data via CSV files, Pandas DataFrames, and APIs. In this module, you’ll upgrade your data management skills by working with another method of data storage and organization: databases. Using a combination of Python, Pandas, and Structured Query Language (SQL), you’ll interact with databases to do analysis tasks and to create sophisticated financial applications.\n",

    "# Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use SQL and Pandas to access stock data from a database and create DataFrames.\n",
    "- Write advanced SQL statements that optimize the process of accessing the data that you need for the analysis.\n",
    "- Create a web application that displays the results of your analysis by using the Voilà Python library.\n",

    "# Why This Matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "People often store and access financial data that resides in databases. SQL has become the standard for querying data—that is, requesting or inquiring about data—from the most commonly used databases in finance. These databases include Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and MySQL.\n",

    "Knowing how to use SQL along with Python will give you an advantage among fintech professionals. Getting and manipulating data via databases and building applications that use databases are invaluable and sophisticated skills.\n",

    "By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:\n",

    "- Perform key database operations (specifically, create, read, update, and delete operations) by using SQL.\n",

    "- Write advanced database queries by using SQL.\n",

    "# Introduction to Financial Databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In finance, vast amounts of data—from credit card transactions to stock data to 401(k) transactions—are generated and stored every day. Because of the speed, size, and dynamic nature of this data, companies need tools to store and access the data in an organized way. They do this through repositories known as databases. Companies use financial databases in particular to build all sorts of financial applications and APIs.\n",

We can also use it with Python to build applications that interact with databases. SQL has become a standard language for people in roles that involve working with data, such as data engineers, data analysts, and data modelers.\n",

    "# Databases vs. DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand databases, let's first discuss CSV files and DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you’ve worked a lot with CSV files—which are text files that store comma-separated values in a row-and-column format. This is called tabular data, which offers an excellent way to store a small amount of data that doesn't change much. However, you've observed the dynamic and varied nature of financial data. Text files just aren't sufficient for analyzing or working with dynamic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas developers realized that financial technologists needed more dynamic ways to access and work with data. So, they created a data container in Python called the DataFrame—which you’ve also worked with extensively. A DataFrame stores the rows and columns of CSV data in a container that many tools can access. These tools help us manipulate and analyze the data. Databases are thus like Pandas DataFrames in that they’re designed to store, access, and analyze data. Unlike Pandas DataFrames, however, databases exist outside Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of Databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases offer a wide range of benefits. These include the ability to handle vast amounts of data and to spread across many computers and networks (which is often referred to as the cloud).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although several database structures exist, the financial sector most commonly uses `relational databases` and `NoSQL `databases.\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "People consider a relational database the most mature of all the database structures. In a relational database, every piece of information has a relationship with every other piece. Additionally, a relational database stores data records as tables, with every table consisting of rows and columns. The rows in a single table relate to each other via a primary key. The tables relate to each other via a foreign key. Because of the formal organizational structure of relational databases, people can understand and navigate them by using a query language like SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database doesn’t keep data in tables. Rather, it uses a simpler, horizontal design. Specifically, it keeps data in documents. When a document is added to the database, it’s assigned an identification number, or key. The key can then be used to access that document. Because of its less rigid structure, people consider NoSQL databases more flexible than relational databases. And NoSQL databases often exhibit a faster querying time. The downside is that the less rigid structure can more easily result in duplicated or missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides relational and NoSQL databases, centralized, distributed, cloud, and object-oriented databases exist. You can explore all of these in more detail in the Tutorials Point database tutorial\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "While many types of databases exist, we’ll focus on relational databases. This type of database stores its data in a table format (that is, in rows and columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn how to interact with a database is to use Python and SQL. In this lesson, we’ll work with a database called SQLite, which we can interact with via Python. However, you can apply the skills that you learn to any relational database, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and cloud databases.\n",
